# Chapter 1: The sky is burning

El Draco felt the cool wind through her wings. Usually it would be a welcome breeze after a sultry hot day, but this time it stung much the same as ice does when building a really large snowman like the humans do. Watching the last rays, she soared higher above the red horizon and thought about what just happened in spite of her best intentions. "_Run_ away, and never come back", said the voice still ringing in her ears. It belonged to the wizened druid on the corner of Rue and Kings boulevard. 

His cauldron of bubble sure had brewed its fair share of trouble over the years. Known around town as 'Haggarold', 'ye old Hag' or 'Mr. H again', he was about as sprightly as a spring onion. He could always take a joke, and better yet played many on the townsfolk. During his latest escapade, while the Mayor gave his speech announcing the winners of the annual tallest-tower-made-from-pumpkins competition, he attached a strange metallic substance to the clapper of the church bell, and muttering 'reverso electromagnesi' under his breath this caused it to ring twenty times a second. The deafening sound toppled the pumpkin towers with a crash that left the mayor grudgingly awarding it the last tower left standing, Mr. H again's.

The memory made El Draco smile fondly, but it didn't last long when she thought of how she had evoked one of the most powerful spells of all time, "█ ██ ███ ██████" and quite by accident too. She went to visit her old friend, and they traded some idle banter while he finished brewing a new potion to wash the laundry. She dusted off a recipe book numbly and read aloud the contents on the third page.

The cauldron spewed its final breath in the form of a potent spell that makes her take on all the knowledge of the person standing next to her. She was not prepared for the staggering transformation in her mind in the next few moments. It was just a little too much. She already knew that he couldn't make another cauldron, and that he was right: she couldn't stay. With a peculiar knowing glance at each other, they parted ways. "_Goodbye old friend_", she thought.

Now here she was floating in the sky, avoiding people for now and reveling at the crazy possibilities that could happen next.
